The code in this repository provides a framework to conduct a diligent replication of the key findings presented in the seminal research study, "Accruals, Cash Flows, and Operating Profitability in the Cross Section of Stock Returns."

Through this replication, we confirm the study's major insights:

Cash-Based Operating Profitability: This metric, devoid of accrual adjustments, is superior to other profitability measures such as gross profitability, operating profitability, and net income in explaining the cross-section of expected stock returns.

Accrual Anomaly Subsumption: The robust predictive power of cash-based operating profitability is such that it subsumes the accrual anomaly. Our replication suggests that an investment strategy focusing solely on this profitability factor could be more effective than those considering both accruals and other profitability measures.

Long-Term Predictive Power: Cash-based operating profitability's ability to predict expected returns extends up to a ten-year horizon.

This body of work provides a cogent reiteration of the original study's main premise â€“ that cash-based profitability plays a crucial role in predicting stock returns, and its importance is distinct from the value premium.

The repository houses the code used in my replication, offering a valuable resource for anyone keen on studying these aspects further.
